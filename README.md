machine learning models - A Master's Thesis

## Structure

The code for performing the anomaliy detection, using 
unsupervised machine learning, can be accessed via the file name: "Full_Code.py"

If it is needed, the code is also divided into subsections, where the ML models are within the respective folder, and all other code, concerning the data preparation or evaluation of data can be found within the folder "Additional_Code".
